# Repository Guidelines

- Follow the existing C coding style: two-space indentation, braces on the same
  line, and GLib/GStreamer idioms where already used.
- Keep documentation in Markdown with descriptive headings and code fences for
  commands.
- Update the README alongside substantive feature additions or new
  configuration options.
